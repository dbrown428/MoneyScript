# MoneyScript
This is just a learning sandbox for TypeScript. 

Thanks to [Adrian Schneider](https://github.com/AdrianSchneider/) for sharing his TypeScript branch of [Qissues](https://github.com/AdrianSchneider/qissues/) to help get things rolling.

##### Get Started
0. build: make
	- this will install dependencies via NPM.
	- compile TypeScript src and test files and store them in the build directory.
0. tests: make test
	- run all the unit tests.
